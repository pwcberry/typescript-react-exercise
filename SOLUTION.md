# Some early thoughts about my solution

There are four panels in the proposed UI design. The top three panels can be defined as components that manage their 
own state. 

The bottom panel is its own component that will contain the Rechart code.

To begin with, the data will be quite simple, and served from a JSON file.

State between data stream events will be kept. Calculations from the previous values will be made on consumption of 
another event.

The mock data is generated by the script at `scripts/datagen.js`. It can be run by:

```shell
npm run generate
```

# Some thoughts following the work on my solution

I have not worked with Tailwind CSS nor Recharts before. These are interesting tools to use when building a React UI.
Tailwind does make it easy to style components quickly and keep the styles modular. I like how the Recharts library 
uses SVG under the hood. There are a couple of CSS classes that I defined that gave me a bit more than what Tailwind provided.

I think the working code is very close to how I envisioned the solution before I started to write the code.

I have written as many unit tests as possible. There are probably more to write.

I gave myself a few hours to complete this task. I have enjoyed working on it.
